<p>It has often been felt a delightful exercise by the child of God, to
take, night by night, an individual promise and plead it at the
mercy-seat. Often are our prayers <i>pointless</i>, from not following, in
this respect, the example of the sweet Psalmist of Israel, the Royal
Promise pleader, who delighted to direct his finger to some particular
&ldquo;word&rdquo; of the Faithful Promiser, saying, &ldquo;Remember Thy word unto Thy
servant, on which thou hast caused me to hope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following are a few gleanings from the Promise Treasury,&mdash;a few
crumbs from &ldquo;the Master&#8217;s Table,&rdquo; which may serve to help the thoughts
in the hour of closet meditation, or the season of sorrow.</p>

<h2>1st Day of Month.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord: Though your sins
be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red
like crimson, they shall be as wool.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> i.&nbsp;18.</p></div>

<h3>Pardoning Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t01.png" alt="Pardoning Grace." title="Pardoning Grace." />
</div>
<p>My soul! thy God summons thee to His audience chamber! Infinite purity
seeks to reason with infinite vileness! Deity stoops to speak to dust!
Dread not the meeting. It is the most gracious, as well as wondrous of
all conferences. Jehovah himself breaks silence! He utters the best
tidings a lost soul or a lost world can hear: &ldquo;God is in Christ
reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing unto men their
trespasses.&rdquo; What! <i>Scarlet</i> sins, and <i>crimson</i> sins! and these all to
be forgiven and forgotten! The just God &ldquo;justifying&rdquo; the unjust!&mdash;the
mightiest of all beings, the kindest of all! Oh! what is there in thee
to merit such love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
as this? Thou mightest have known thy God only as the &ldquo;consuming fire,&rdquo;
and had nothing before thee save &ldquo;a fearful looking for of vengeance!&rdquo;
This gracious conference bids thee dispel thy fears! It tells thee it is
no longer a &ldquo;fearful,&rdquo; but a <i>blessed</i> thing to fall into His hands?
Hast thou closed with these His overtures? Until thou art at peace with
Him, happiness must be a stranger to thy bosom. Though thou hast all
else beside, bereft of God thou must be &ldquo;bereft indeed.&rdquo; Lord! I come!
As thy pardoning grace is freely tendered, so shall I freely accept it.
May it be mine, even now, to listen to the gladdening accents, &ldquo;Son!
Daughter! be of good cheer! thy sins, which are many, are all forgiven
thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>
<span class="smaller">WORD UNTO THY SERVANT, UPON WHICH THOU HAST CAUSED

<h2>2d Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;As thy days, so shall thy strength
be.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deut.</span> xxxiii.&nbsp;25.</p></div>

<h3>Needful Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t02.png" alt="Needful Grace." title="Needful Grace." />
</div>
<p>God does not give grace till the hour of trial comes. But when it
<i>does</i> come, the amount of grace, and the nature of the special grace
required is vouchsafed. My soul, do not dwell with painful apprehension
on the future. Do not anticipate coming sorrows; perplexing thyself with
the grace needed for future emergencies; to-morrow will bring its
promised grace along with to-morrow&#8217;s trials. God, wishing to keep His
people humble, and dependent on himself, gives not a stock of grace; He
metes it out for every day&#8217;s exigencies, that they may be constantly
&ldquo;travelling between their own emptiness and Christ&#8217;s fulness&rdquo;&mdash;their own
weakness and Christ&#8217;s strength. But <i>when</i> the exigency comes, thou
mayest safely trust an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Almighty arm to bear thee through! Is there now some &ldquo;thorn in the
flesh&rdquo; sent to lacerate thee? Thou mayest have been entreating the Lord
for its removal. Thy prayer has, doubtless, been heard and answered; but
not in the way, perhaps, expected or desired by thee. The &ldquo;thorn&rdquo; may
still be left to goad, the trial may still be left to buffet; but &ldquo;more
grace&rdquo; has been given to endure them. Oh! how often have His people thus
been led to glory in their infirmities and triumph in their afflictions,
seeing the power of Christ rests more abundantly upon them! The strength
which the hour of trial brings, often makes the Christian a wonder to
himself!</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>
<span class="smaller">WORD UNTO THY SERVANT, UPON WHICH THOU HAST CAUSED

<h2>3d Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always
having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good
work.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">2 Cor.</span> ix.&nbsp;8.</p></div>

<h3>All-Sufficient Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t03.png" alt="All-Sufficient Grace." title="All-Sufficient Grace." />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All-sufficiency in all things!&rdquo; Believer! surely thou art &ldquo;thoroughly
furnished!&rdquo; Grace is no scanty thing, doled out in pittances. It is a
glorious treasury, which the key of prayer can always unlock, but never
empty. A fountain, &ldquo;full, flowing, <i>ever</i> flowing, <i>over</i>flowing.&rdquo; Mark
these three ALL&#8217;s in this precious promise. It is a three-fold link in a
golden chain, let down from a throne of grace by a God of grace.
&ldquo;<i>All-grace!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>all-sufficiency!</i>&rdquo; in &ldquo;<i>all things!</i>&rdquo; and these to
&ldquo;abound.&rdquo; Oh! precious thought! My want cannot impoverish that
inexhaustible treasury of grace! Myriads are hourly hanging on it, and drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
from it, and yet there is no diminution: &ldquo;Out of that fulness all we too
may receive, and grace for grace!&rdquo; My soul, dost not thou love to dwell
on that all-abounding grace? Thine own insufficiency in every thing, met
with an &ldquo;all-sufficiency in all things!&rdquo; Grace in all circumstances and
situations, in all vicissitudes and changes, in all the varied phases of
the Christian&#8217;s being. Grace in sunshine and storm&mdash;in health and
in sickness&mdash;in life and in death. Grace for the old believer and
the young believer, the tried believer, and the weak believer, and the
tempted believer. Grace <i>for</i> duty, and grace <i>in</i> duty,&mdash;grace to
carry the joyous cup with a steady hand,&mdash;grace to drink the bitter
cup with an unmurmuring spirit,&mdash;grace to have prosperity
sanctified,&mdash;grace to say, through tears, &ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>

<h2>4th Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to
you.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">John</span> xiv.&nbsp;18.</p></div>

<h3>Comforting Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t04.png" alt="Comforting Grace." title="Comforting Grace." />
</div>
<p>Blessed Jesus! How thy presence sanctifies trial, takes loneliness from
the chamber of sickness, and the sting from the chamber of death! Bright
and Morning Star! precious at all times, thou art never <i>so</i> precious as
in &ldquo;the dark and cloudy day!&rdquo; The bitterness of sorrow is well worth
enduring to have thy promised consolations. How well qualified, thou Man
of Sorrows, to be my Comforter! How well fitted to dry my tears, Thou
who didst shed so many thyself! What are <i>my</i> tears&mdash;my sorrows&mdash;my
crosses&mdash;my losses, compared with Thine, who didst shed first Thy tears,
and then Thy blood for <i>me</i>! Mine are all deserved, and infinitely more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
deserved. How different, O Spotless Lamb of God, those pangs which rent
Thy guiltless bosom! How sweet those comforts Thou hast promised to the
comfortless, when I think of them as flowing from an Almighty
<i>Fellow-Sufferer</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;A brother born for adversity,&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;Friend that sticketh closer than any brother!&rdquo;&mdash;one who can say,
with all the refined sympathies of a holy exalted human nature, &ldquo;I know
your sorrows!&rdquo; My soul! calm thy griefs! There is not a sorrow thou
canst experience, but Jesus, in the treasury of grace, has an exact
corresponding solace: &ldquo;In the multitude of the <i>sorrows</i> I have in my
heart, Thy <i>comforts</i> delight my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>

<h2>5th Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but
I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span> xxii.&nbsp;31,
32.</p></div>

<h3>Restraining Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t05.png" alt="Restraining Grace." title="Restraining Grace." />
</div>
<p>What a scene does this unfold! Satan tempting&mdash;Jesus praying! Satan
sifting&mdash;Jesus pleading! &ldquo;The strong man assailing&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the stronger than
the strong&rdquo; beating him back! Believer? here is the past history and
present secret of thy safety in the midst of temptation. An interceding
Saviour was at thy side, saying to every threatening wave, &ldquo;Thus far
shalt thou go, and no farther?&rdquo; God often permits His people to be on
the very verge of the precipice, to remind them of their own weakness;
<i>but never farther than the verge!</i> The restraining hand and grace of
Omnipotence is ready to rescue them. &ldquo;Although he fall, yet shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
he not be cast down utterly; and why? for the Lord upholdeth him with
His right hand!&rdquo; The wolf may be prowling for his prey; but what can he
do when the Shepherd is always there, tending with the watchful eye that
&ldquo;neither slumbers nor sleeps?&rdquo; Who cannot subscribe to the testimony,
&ldquo;When my foot slipped, Thy mercy, O Lord! held me up?&rdquo; Who can look back
on his past pilgrimage, and fail to see it crowded with Ebenezers, with
this inscription: &ldquo;Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes
from tears, and my feet from falling?&rdquo; My soul, where wouldst thou have
been this day, hadst thou not been &ldquo;<i>kept</i>&rdquo; by the power of God?</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>

<h2>6th Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I will heal their
backsliding.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hosea</span> xiv.&nbsp;4.</p></div>

<h3>Restoring Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t06.png" alt="Restoring Grace." title="Restoring Grace." />
</div>
<p>Wandering again! And has He not left me to perish? Stumbling and
straying on the dark mountains, away from the Shepherd&#8217;s eye and the
Shepherd&#8217;s fold, shall He not leave the erring wanderer to the fruit of
his own ways, and his truant heart to go hopelessly onward in its career
of guilty estrangement? &ldquo;My thoughts,&rdquo; says God, &ldquo;are not as your
thoughts, neither are your ways my ways.&rdquo; Man would say, &ldquo;Go, perish!
ungrateful apostate!&rdquo; God says, &ldquo;Return, ye backsliding children!&rdquo; The
Shepherd <i>will</i> not, <i>cannot</i> suffer the sheep to perish He has
purchased with His own blood. How wondrous His forbearance towards
it!&mdash;tracking its guilty steps, and ceasing not the pursuit till He lays the wanderer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
on His shoulders, and returns with it to His fold rejoicing! My soul!
why increase by farther departures thine own distance from the
fold?&mdash;why lengthen the dreary road thy gracious Shepherd has to
traverse in bringing thee back? Delay not thy return! Provoke no longer
His patience; venture no farther on forbidden ground. He waits with
outstretched arms to welcome thee once more to His bosom. Be humble for
the past, trust Him for the future. Think of thy former backslidings,
and tremble; think of His forbearance, and be filled with holy
gratitude; think of His promised grace, &ldquo;and take courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>

<h2>7th Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the
day of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Phil.</span> i.&nbsp;6.</p></div>

<h3>Sanctifying Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t07.png" alt="Sanctifying Grace." title="Sanctifying Grace." />
</div>
<p>Reader! is the good work begun in thee? Art thou holy? Is sin
crucifying? Are thy heart&#8217;s idols, one by one abolished? Is the world
less to thee, and eternity more to thee? Is more of thy Saviour&#8217;s image
impressed on thy character, and thy Saviour&#8217;s love more enthroned in thy
heart? Is &ldquo;Salvation&rdquo; to thee more &ldquo;the one thing needful?&rdquo; Oh! take
heed! there can be no middle ground, no standing still; or if it be so,
thy position must be a false one. The Saviour&#8217;s blood is not more
necessary to give thee a title to Heaven, than His Spirit to give thee a
meetness for it. &ldquo;If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is <i>none
of His</i>!&rdquo; &ldquo;Onwards!&rdquo; should be thy motto. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
is no standing still in the life of faith. &ldquo;The man,&rdquo; says Augustine,
&ldquo;who says &lsquo;<i>Enough</i>,&rsquo; that man&#8217;s soul is lost?&rdquo; Let this be the
superscription in all thy ways and doings, &ldquo;Holiness to the Lord.&rdquo; Let
the monitory word exercise over thee its habitual power, &ldquo;Without
holiness no man shall see the Lord.&rdquo; Moreover, remember, that to be
holy, is to be happy. The two are convertible terms. Holiness! It is the
secret and spring of the joy of angels; and the more of holiness
attained on earth&mdash;the nearer and closer my walk is with
God&mdash;the more of a sweet earnest shall I have of the bliss that
awaits me in a holy Heaven. Oh! my soul, let it be thy sacred ambition
to &ldquo;Be holy!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>
<span class="smaller">WORD UNTO THY SERVANT, UPON WHICH THOU HAST CAUSED

<h2>8th Day.</h2>

<p class="faithful">&ldquo;He is Faithful that Promised.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be

<h3>Reviving Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t08.png" alt="Reviving Grace." title="Reviving Grace." />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou not revive us, O Lord?&rdquo; My soul! art thou conscious of thy
declining state? Is thy walk less with God, thy frame less heavenly?
Hast thou less conscious nearness to the mercy-seat,&mdash;diminished
communion with thy Saviour? Is prayer less a privilege than it has
been?&mdash;the pulsations of spiritual life more languid, and fitful, and
spasmodic?&mdash;the bread of life less relished?&mdash;the seen, and the
temporal, and the tangible, displacing the unseen and eternal? Art thou
sinking down into this state of drowsy self-contentment, this
conformity-life with the world, forfeiting all the happiness of true
religion, and risking and endangering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the better life to come? Arise! call upon thy God! &ldquo;Wilt thou not revive
us, O Lord?&rdquo; He might have returned nothing but the withering repulse,
&ldquo;How often would I have gathered thee; but thou wouldst not!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ephraim
is joined to his idols; let him alone!&rdquo; But &ldquo;in wrath He remembers
mercy.&rdquo; &ldquo;They <i>shall</i> revive as the corn.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it.&rdquo; How and where is reviving grace to be found? He gives thee,
in this precious promise, the key. It is on thy bended <i>knees</i>&mdash;by
a return to thy deserted and unfrequented chamber! &ldquo;<i>They that wait upon
the Lord!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait on the Lord; be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen
thine heart; wait, I say, on the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Persevering Grace.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t09.png" alt="Persevering Grace." title="Persevering Grace." />
</div>
<p>Reader! how comforting to thee amid the ebbings and flowings of thy
changing history, to know that the change is all with thee, and not with
thy God! Thy spiritual bark may be tossed on waves of temptation, in
many a dark midnight. Thou mayest think thy pilot hath left thee, and be
ready continually to say, &ldquo;Where is my God?&rdquo; But fear not! The bark
which bears thy spiritual destinies is in better hands than thine; a
golden chain of covenant love links it to the eternal throne! That chain
can never snap asunder. He who holds it in His hand gives thee <i>this</i> as
the pledge of thy safety,&mdash;&ldquo;Because I live, ye shall live also.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why
art thou then cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
within me? <i>hope thou in God!</i>&rdquo; Thou wilt assuredly ride out these
stormy surges, and reach the desired haven. But be faithful with
thyself: see that there be nothing to hinder or impede thy growth in
grace. Think how little may retard thy progress. One sin
indulged&mdash;one temptation tampered with&mdash;one bosom traitor, may
cost thee many a bitter hour and bitter tear, by separating between thee
and thy God. Make it thy daily prayer, &ldquo;Search me, O God, and know my
heart; try me and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way
in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="remember">&ldquo;<span class="smaller">REMEMBER</span> <i>THIS</i>

</div>
<p>And from whom could dying grace come so welcome, as from Thee, O
blessed Jesus? Not only is Thy name, &ldquo;The Abolisher of Death;&rdquo; but Thou
didst thyself <i>die</i>! Thou hast sanctified the grave by Thine own
presence, and divested it of all its terrors. My soul! art thou at times
afraid of this, thy last enemy? If the rest of thy pilgrimage-way be
peaceful and unclouded, rests there a dark and portentous shadow over
the terminating portals? Fear not! When that dismal entrance is reached,
He who has &ldquo;the keys of the grave and of death&rdquo; suspended at His golden
girdle, will impart grace to bear thee through. It is the messenger of
peace. Thy Saviour calls thee! The promptings of nature, when, at first,
thou seest the

darkening waves, may be that of the affrighted disciples, when they
said, &ldquo;It is a spirit, and cried out for fear!&rdquo; But a gentle voice will
be heard high above the storm, &ldquo;It is I! Be not afraid!&rdquo; Death, indeed,
as the wages of sin, must, even by the believer, be regarded as an
enemy. But, oh! blessed thought, it is thy <i>last</i> enemy&mdash;the cause
of thy last tear. In a few brief moments after that tear is shed, thy
God will be wiping every vestige of it away? &ldquo;O Death! where is thy
sting? O Grave! where is thy victory? Thanks be unto God, who giveth us
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo; Welcome, vanquished
foe!&mdash;Birthday of heaven!&mdash;&ldquo;to die is gain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh! happy day, when this toilsome warfare will all be ended, Jordan
crossed, Canaan entered, the legion-enemies of the wilderness no longer
dreaded; sorrow, sighing, death, and, worst of all, <i>sin</i>, no more
either to be felt or feared! Here is the terminating link in the golden
chain of the everlasting covenant. It began with <i>predestination</i>; it
ends with <i>glorification</i>. It began with sovereign grace in a by-past
eternity, and no link will be awanting till the ransomed spirit be
presented faultless before the throne! Grace and glory! If the earnest
be sweet, what must be the reality? If the wilderness table contain such
rich provision, what must be the glories of the eternal banqueting
house? Oh! my soul, make sure of

Has grace begun in thee? Canst thou mark&mdash;though it should be but
the drops of the incipient rill which is to terminate in such an
ocean&mdash;the tiny grains which are to accumulate and issue in such

as thou didst of old to thy mourning disciples, and breathe upon it, and
say, &ldquo;Receive ye the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; It is the mightiest of all boons; but,
like the sun in the heavens, it is the freest of all: &ldquo;For if ye, being

say, &ldquo;I <i>know</i> that thy judgments are good;&rdquo; and, relying in the dark,
to exclaim, &ldquo;Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him!&rdquo; Blessed Jesus! to
thee are committed the reins of this universal empire. The same hand
that was once nailed to the cross, is now wielding the sceptre on the
throne,&mdash;&ldquo;all power given unto thee in heaven and in earth.&rdquo; How
can I doubt the wisdom, and faithfulness, and love, of the most
mysterious earthly dealing, when I know that the Roll of Providence is

privations, to the city of habitation. Oh! the blessedness of thus lying
passive in the hands of God; saying, &ldquo;Undertake thou for
me!&rdquo;&mdash;dwelling with holy gratitude on past mercies and
interpositions&mdash;taking these as pledges of future faithfulness and
love&mdash;hearing His voice behind us, amid life&#8217;s manifold
perplexities, exclaiming, &ldquo;This is the way, walk ye in it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Happy,&rdquo;

<p>Sorrowing Believer! what couldst thou wish more than this? Thy furnace
is severe; but look at this assurance of Him who lighted it. Love is the
fuel that feeds its flames! Its every spark is love! Kindled by a
Father&#8217;s hand, and designed as a special pledge of a Father&#8217;s love. How
many of his dear children has He so rebuked and chastened; and all,
<i>all</i> for one reason, &ldquo;<i>I love them!</i>&rdquo; The myriads in glory have passed
through these furnace-fires,&mdash;<i>there</i> they were chosen,&mdash;<i>there</i> they
were purified, sanctified, and made &ldquo;vessels meet for the Master&#8217;s use;&rdquo;
the dross and the alloy purged, that the pure metal might remain. And
art thou to claim exemption from the same discipline? Art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
thou to think it strange concerning these same fiery trials that may be
trying thee? Rather exult in them as thine adoption-privilege. Envy not
those who are strangers to the refining flames,&mdash;who are &ldquo;<i>without
chastisement</i>;&rdquo; rather, surely, the severest discipline <i>with</i> a
<i>Father&#8217;s love</i>, than the fullest earthly cup without that Father&#8217;s
smile. Oh! for grace to say, when the furnace is hottest, and the rod
sorest, &ldquo;Even so, <i>Father</i>!&rdquo; And what, after all, is the severest of thy
chastisements in comparison with what thy sins have deserved? Dost thou
murmur under a Father&#8217;s correcting love? What would it have been to have
stood the wrath of an unpropitiated Judge, and that, too, <i>for ever</i>?
Surely, in the light of eternity, the heaviest pang of earth is indeed
&ldquo;a light affliction!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Three gracious words! Not one of all my tears shed for nought! Not one
stroke of the rod unheeded, or that might have been spared? Thy heavenly
Father loves thee too much, and too tenderly, to bestow harsher
correction than thy case requires? Is it loss of health, or loss of
wealth, or loss of beloved friends? Be still! there was a <i>need be</i>. We
are no judges of what that &ldquo;need be&rdquo; is; often through aching hearts we
are forced to exclaim, &ldquo;Thy judgments are a great deep!&rdquo; But God here
pledges himself, that there will not be one redundant thorn in the
believer&#8217;s chaplet of suffering. No burden too heavy will be laid on him;
and no sacrifice too great exacted <i>from</i> him. He will &ldquo;temper the wind to

quenched. &ldquo;If need be!&rdquo; Oh! what a pillow on which to rest thy aching
head,&mdash;that there is not a drop in all thy bitter cup but what a
God of love saw to be <i>absolutely</i> necessary! Wilt thou not trust Him,
even though thou canst not trace the mystery of His dealings? Not too
curiously prying into the &ldquo;<i>Why</i> it is?&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>How</i> it is?&rdquo; but satisfied
that &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; and, therefore that all <i>must</i> be well! &ldquo;Although thou

<p>Will Jesus accept such a heart as mine?&mdash;this erring, treacherous,

assurance: &ldquo;Fear not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy

<p>&ldquo;Cast out!&rdquo; My soul! how oft might this have been thy history! Thou
hast cast off thy God,&mdash;might He not oft have &ldquo;cast out&rdquo; thee? Yes! cast
thee out as fuel for the fire of His wrath,&mdash;a sapless, fruitless
cumberer. And yet, notwithstanding all thine ungrateful requital for His
unmerited forbearance, He is still declaring, &ldquo;As I live, saith the
Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth.&rdquo; Thy sins may
be legion-like,&mdash;the sand of the sea may be their befitting type,&mdash;the
thought of their turpitude and aggravation may be ready to overwhelm

and softened because of thy guilt, resolve to dedicate thyself anew to
His service, and so coming, &ldquo;He will <i>by no means</i> cast thee out!&rdquo;
Despond not by reason of former shortcomings,&mdash;thy sins are great,
but thy Saviour&#8217;s merits are greater. He is willing to forget all the
past, and sink it in oblivion, if there be present love, and the promise
of future obedience. &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonas, <i>lovest thou me</i>?&rdquo; Ah! how
different is God&#8217;s verdict from man&#8217;s! After such sins as thine, man&#8217;s

<p>Believer! all the glory of thy salvation belongs to Jesus,&mdash;none to

weary. Gird on thine armour for fresh conquests. Be gaining daily some
new victory over sin. Deny thyself. Be a willing cross-bearer for thy
Lord&#8217;s sake. Do good to all men as thou hast opportunity; be patient

bearing Christ&#8217;s spirit, and sharing Christ&#8217;s cross. And when the

&ldquo;Mourners,&rdquo; and their pilgrimage-home a &ldquo;Valley of Tears?&rdquo; Bereavement,
and sickness, and poverty, and death, following the track of sin, add to
their mourning experience; and with many of God&#8217;s best beloved, one tear
is scarce dried when another is ready to flow! Mourners! rejoice! When
the reaping time comes, the weeping time ends! When the white robe and
the golden harp are bestowed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
every remnant of the sackcloth attire is
removed. The moment the pilgrim, whose forehead is here furrowed with
woe, bathes it in the crystal river of life,&mdash;that moment the pangs of a
lifetime of sorrow are eternally forgotten! Reader! if thou art one of
these careworn ones, the days of thy mourning are numbered! A few more
throbbings of this aching heart, and then the angel who proclaims
&ldquo;time,&rdquo; shall proclaim also, sorrow, and sighing, and mourning, to &ldquo;be
no longer!&rdquo; Seek now to mourn thy sins more than thy sorrows; reserve
thy bitterest tears for forgetfulness of thy dear Lord. The saddest and
sorest of all bereavements, is when the sins which have separated thee
from Him, evoke the anguish-cry, &ldquo;Where is my God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so! come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why tarry the wheels of Thy chariot?&rdquo; Six
thousand years this world has rolled on, getting hoary with age, and
wrinkled with sins and sorrows. A waiting Church sees the long-drawn
shadows of twilight announcing, &ldquo;The Lord is at hand.&rdquo; Prepare, my soul,
to meet Him. Oh! happy days, when thine adorable Redeemer, so long
dishonoured and despised, shall be publicly enthroned, in presence of an
assembled universe, crowned Lord of All, glorified in His saints,
satisfied in the fruits of His soul&#8217;s travail, destroying His enemies
with the brightness of His coming&mdash;the lightning-glance of

a joyous thought to thee,&mdash;thy &ldquo;blessed hope,&rdquo;&mdash;the meeting of thine
Elder Brother. Stand oftentimes on the watchtower to catch the first
streak of that coming brightness, the first murmur of these chariot
wheels. The world is now in preparation! It is rocking on its worn-out
axle. There are voices on every side proclaiming, &ldquo;He cometh! He cometh!
to judge the earth.&rdquo; Reader! art thou among the number of those who
&ldquo;love His appearing?&rdquo; Remember the attitude of His expectant saints:
&ldquo;Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when He cometh, will find

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t24.png" alt="Eventide Light." title="Eventide Light." />
</div>
<p>How inspiring the thought of coming glory! How would we rise above our
sins, and sorrows, and sufferings, if we could live under the power of
&ldquo;a world to come!&rdquo; Were faith to take at all times its giant leap beyond
a soul-trammelling earth, and remember its brighter destiny. If it could
stand on its Pisgah Mount, and look above and beyond the mists and
vapours of this land of shadows, and rest on the &ldquo;better country.&rdquo; But,
alas! in spite of ourselves, the wings ofttimes refuse to soar&mdash;the
spirit droops&mdash;guilty fears depress&mdash;sin dims and darkens&mdash;God&#8217;s
providences seem to frown&mdash;God&#8217;s ways are misinterpreted&mdash;the Christian
belies his name and his destiny. But, &ldquo;At eventide it shall be light.&rdquo;&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
material sun, which wades through clouds and a troubled sky, sets often
in a couch of lustrous gold? So, when the sun of life is setting, many a
ray of light will shoot athwart memory&#8217;s darkened sky, and many
mysterious dealings of the wilderness will then elicit an &ldquo;All is well!&rdquo;
How frequently is the presence and upholding grace of Jesus especially
felt and acknowledged at that hour, and griefs and misgivings hushed
with His own gentle accents, &ldquo;Fear not! it is I; be not afraid.&rdquo; A
triumphant death-bed! It is no unmeaning word; the eye is lighted with
holy lustre, the tongue with holy rapture, as if the harps of heaven
were stealing on it. My soul! may such a life&#8217;s evening-tide be thine!</p>

</div>
<p>As the natural sun sometimes sinks in clouds, so, occasionally, the
Christian who has a bright rising, and a brighter meridian, sets in
gloom. It is not <i>always</i> &ldquo;light&rdquo; at his evening-time; but this we know,
that when the day of immortality breaks, the last vestige of earth&#8217;s
shadows will for ever flee away. To the closing hour of time, Providence
may be to him a baffling enigma: but ere the first hour has struck on
heaven&#8217;s chronometer, all will be clear. My soul! &ldquo;in God&#8217;s light thou
shalt see light;&rdquo; the Book of His decrees is a sealed book now,&mdash;&ldquo;A
great deep&rdquo; is all the explanation thou canst often give to His
judgments; the <i>why</i> and the <i>wherefore</i> He seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
keep from us, to test our faith, to discipline us in trustful
submission, and lead us to say, &ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo; But rejoice in that
hereafter-light which awaits thee! Now we see through a glass darkly;
but <i>then</i>, face to face. In the great mirror of eternity all the events
of this chequered scene will be reflected; the darkest of them will be
seen to be bright with mercy,&mdash;the severest dispensations, &ldquo;only
the severer aspects of His love!&rdquo; Pry not, then, too curiously;
pronounce not too censoriously on God&#8217;s dealings with thee. Wait with
patience till the grand day of disclosures; one confession shall then
burst from every tongue, &ldquo;Righteous art thou, O Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the meeting of a long absent friend, or brother, on earth, be a
joyous event, what, my soul, must be the joy of thy union with this
Brother of brothers, this Friend of friends! &ldquo;I will come again!&rdquo; Oh!
what an errand of love, what a promised honour and dignity is this!&mdash;His
saints to share, not His Heaven only, but His immediate presence. &ldquo;Where
<i>I am, there ye</i> shall be also!&rdquo; &ldquo;Father, I <i>will</i> (it was His dying
wish,&mdash;a wondrous codicil in that testamentary prayer) that those whom
Thou hast given me be with me where <i>I am</i>.&rdquo; Happy reunion! Blessed
Saviour, if Thy presence be so sweet on a sin-stricken earth, and when
known only by the invisible eye of faith, what must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be that presence in
a sinless Heaven, unfolded in all its unutterable loveliness and glory!
Happy reunion! it will be a meeting of the whole ransomed family&mdash;the
Head with all its members&mdash;the Vine with all its branches&mdash;the Shepherd
with all His flock&mdash;the Elder Brother with all His kinsmen. Oh, the joy,
too, of mutual recognition among the death-divided&mdash;ties snapt asunder
on earth, indissolubly renewed&mdash;severed friendships reunited&mdash;the
triumph of love complete&mdash;love binding brother with brother, and friend
with friend, and <i>all</i> to the Elder Brother! My soul! what thinkest thou
of this Heaven? Remember who it is that Jesus says shall sit with Him
upon His throne,&mdash;&ldquo;Him that overcometh.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Everlasting Espousals.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t27.png" alt="Everlasting Espousals." title="Everlasting Espousals." />
</div>
<p>How wondrous and varied are the figures which Jesus employs to express
the tenderness of His covenant love! My soul! thy Saviour-God hath
&ldquo;married thee!&rdquo; Wouldst thou know the hour of thy betrothment? Go back
into the depths of a by-past eternity, before the world was; then and
there, thine espousals were contracted: &ldquo;I have loved thee with an
everlasting love.&rdquo; Soon shall the bridal-hour arrive, when thine absent
Lord shall come to welcome His betrothed bride into His royal palace.
&ldquo;The Bridegroom tarrieth;&rdquo; but see that thou dost not slumber and sleep!
Surely there is much all around demanding the girded loins and the
burning lamps. At &ldquo;midnight!&rdquo; (the hour when He is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
least expected) the cry <i>may</i> be&mdash;<i>shall</i> be heard,&mdash;&ldquo;Behold,
the Bridegroom cometh!&rdquo; My soul! has this mystic union been formed
between thee and thy Lord? Canst thou say, in humble assurance of thine
affiance in Him, &ldquo;My beloved is mine, and I am His!&rdquo; If so, great,
unspeakably great, are the glories which await thee! Thy dowry, as the
bride of Christ, is all that Omnipotence can bestow, and all that a
feeble creature can receive. In the prospect of those glorious nuptials,
thou needest dread no pang of widowhood. What God has joined together,
no created power can take asunder; He betroths thee, and it is &ldquo;for
ever!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Marvel of marvels? The sleeping ashes of the sepulchre starting at the
tones of the archangel&#8217;s trumpet!&mdash;the dishonoured dust, rising a
glorified body, like its risen Lord&#8217;s? At death, the soul&#8217;s bliss is
perfect in kind; but this bliss is not complete in degree, until
reunited to the tabernacle it has left behind to mingle with the sods of
the valley. But tread lightly on that grave, it contains precious,
because ransomed dust! My body, as well as my spirit, was included in
the redemption price of Calvary; and &ldquo;them also which sleep in Jesus
will God bring with Him.&rdquo; Oh! blessed Jubilee-day of creation, when
Christ&#8217;s &ldquo;dead men shall arise;&rdquo;&mdash;when, together with His dead body,
they shall come; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
summons shall sound forth, &ldquo;Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust!&rdquo;
All the joys of that resurrection morn we cannot tell; but its chief
glory we <i>do</i> know,&mdash;&ldquo;When He shall appear, we shall be like Him;
for we shall see Him as He is.&rdquo; Like Him!&mdash;My soul, art thou
waiting this manifestation of the sons of God? Like Him!&mdash;Hast thou
caught up any faint resemblance to that all-glorious image? Having this
hope in thee, art thou purifying thyself, even as He is pure? Be much
with Jesus now, that thou mayst exult in meeting Him hereafter. Thus
taking Him as thy Guide and Portion in life, thou mayst lay thee down in
thy dark and noisome cell, and look forward with triumphant hope to the
dawn of a resurrection morn, saying, &ldquo;What time I awake, I am still with
Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My soul! is it night with thee here? Art thou wearied with these
midnight tossings on life&#8217;s tumultuous sea? Be still! the day is
breaking! soon shall thy Lord appear. &ldquo;His going forth is prepared as
the morning.&rdquo; That glorious appearing shall disperse every cloud, and
usher in an eternal noontide which knows no twilight. &ldquo;Thy sun shall no
more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the Lord shall
be thine everlasting light.&rdquo; Everlasting light! Wondrous secret of a
nightless world!&mdash;the glories of a present God!&mdash;the everlasting light
of the Three in One, quenching the radiance of all created
orbs&mdash;superseding all material luminaries. &ldquo;My soul waiteth for the Lord

dark waves is bringing thee nearer the eternal shore. Wilt thou not,
then, humbly and patiently endure &ldquo;weeping for the night,&rdquo; in the
prospect of the &ldquo;joy that cometh in the morning?&rdquo; Strange realities! a
world without night&mdash;a firmament without a sun; and, greater wonder
still, <i>thyself</i> in this world,&mdash;a joyful denizen of this
nightless, sinless, sorrowless, tearless Heaven!&mdash;basking
underneath the Fountain of uncreated light! No exhaustion of glorified
body and spirit to require repose; no lassitude or weariness to suspend

<p>What! is the beggar to be &ldquo;raised from the dunghill, set among princes,

of despair, raised to the heights of Heaven&mdash;gifted with kingly
honour&mdash;royally fed&mdash;royally clothed&mdash;royally attended&mdash;and, at last,
royally crowned? O my soul, look forward with joyous emotion to that day

some perishable nothings of earth? Oh! that thou wouldst awake to thy

of a Kingly Commonwealth, a member of the blood-royal of Heaven. What
